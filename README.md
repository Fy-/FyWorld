## FyWorld Future / End :(
I love FyWorld and would love nothing more than doing it full time but unfortunately, I don't have the income to support a project like this - so to be honest and straightforward unless I can achieve my goal on Patreon or find another source of revenue, I will not continue this project.
I know a lot of people have contacted me for help and that is great, and I am really grateful to all of you, but unfortunately, I cannot live with gratitude. Some people may see this post as a scam/money grab. It's not It's just facts: I work 7h / day - 5/6 days a week and when I'm on leave I just want to disconnect from the programming world.
If I could continue, the next video would probably be a "light" mobile version of FyWorld: a mini simulation game.
After that in the main game, I'd like to switch behavior trees to ECS / GOAP and maybe migrate from 2D to low poly 3D.
Anyway, thanks for all the support and sorry I couldn't continue. The only way I could if is someone wanted to finance the project, no luck atm ^^

## About
FyWorld is a top down simulation game in a fantasy medieval world.  
It’s a base-building / simulation open source game made with Unity and I’m recording everything. You can look at this like a mega-tutorial or just a crazy geek trying to make a Rimworld like game while streaming everything.  
Fy World was created by Florian "Fy-" Gasquez, whose work was supported via:

## Story
> There was a time long ago when humans wandered the world in great numbers. There was a time of legends and heroes, of incredible accomplishments and great deeds, a time when the world knew true grandeur. But this time is ending and a God watching this extinction event with amusement decide to let escape some people through a magic portal

The chosen ones arrive in this new hostile world and you’ll need to guide your new belivers, help them manage their health, habitations, occupations and needs. All your choices will have consequences on this new fragile realm.  
Do you feel worthy of being a God?
